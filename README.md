# Shoe Counterfeit Detection

Fake Project is a machine learning project focused on identifying fake products authenticity. 
The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset of authentic and counterfeit shoe images.

The inspiration behind this project comes from the iconic **Nike Air Force 1**,
a sneaker that has transcended generations and cultural boundaries since its release in 1982.
As one of the most recognizable and influential sneakers in history,
the AF1 holds significant value in streetwear culture and the global sneaker market.
However, its popularity has also made it a prime target for counterfeit production, which this project aims to combat.
